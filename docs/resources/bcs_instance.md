## Timeouts

This resource provides the following timeouts configuration options:

* `create` - Default is 90 minutes.
* `delete` - Default is 30 minutes.

## Import

The BCS instance can be imported using `id`, e.g.

```bash
$ terraform import huaweicloud_bcs_instance.test <id>
```

Note that the imported state may not be identical to your resource definition, due to some attributes missing from the
API response, security or some other reason.
The missing attributes include: `delete_storage`, `eip_enable`, `enterprise_project_id`, `fabric_version`,
`orderer_node_num`, `org_disk_size`, `password` and `volume_type`.
It is generally recommended running `terraform plan` after importing a instance.
You can then decide if changes should be applied to the instance, or the resource definition should be updated to
align with the instance. Also you can ignore changes as below.

```hcl
resource "huaweicloud_bcs_instance" "test" {
    ...

  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [
      delete_storage, eip_enable, enterprise_project_id, fabric_version, orderer_node_num, org_disk_size, password, volume_type,
    ]
  }
}
```
