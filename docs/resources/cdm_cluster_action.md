  type       = "restart"

  restart {
    level      = "SERVICE"
    mode       = "IMMEDIATELY"
  }
}
```

### Restart vm

```hcl
variable "cdm_cluster_id" {}

resource "huaweicloud_cdm_cluster_action" "restart" {

  type       = "restart"

  restart {
    level      = "VM"
    mode       = "FORCIBLY"
    delay_time = 0
  }
}
```

### Start a cluster

```hcl
variable "cdm_cluster_id" {}

resource "huaweicloud_cdm_cluster_action" "start" {
  cluster_id = var.cdm_cluster_id
  type       = "start"
}
```
