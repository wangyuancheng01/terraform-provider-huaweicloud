## Import

The CSS cluster scan task can be imported using `cluster_id` and `name` separated by a slash, e.g.

```bash
$ terraform import huaweicloud_css_scan_task.test <cluster_id>/<name>
```

Note that the imported state may not be identical to your resource definition, due to the attribute missing from the
API response. The missing attribute is: `alarm`.
It is generally recommended running `terraform plan` after importing a scan task.
You can then decide if changes should be applied to the scan task, or the resource definition should be updated to align
with the scan task. Also you can ignore changes as below.

```hcl
resource "huaweicloud_css_scan_task" "test" {
  ...

  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [
      alarm,
    ]
  }
}
```
