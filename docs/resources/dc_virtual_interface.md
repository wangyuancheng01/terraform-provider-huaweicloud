# huaweicloud_dc_virtual_interface

Manages a virtual interface resource within HuaweiCloud.

## Example Usage

```hcl
variable "direct_connect_id" {}
variable "gateway_id" {}
variable "interface_name" {}

resource "huaweicloud_dc_virtual_interface" "test" {
  direct_connect_id = var.direct_connect_id
  vgw_id            = var.gateway_id
  name              = var.interface_name
  type              = "private"
  route_mode        = "static"
  vlan              = 522
  bandwidth         = 5

  remote_ep_group = [
    "1.1.1.0/30",
  ]

  address_family       = "ipv4"
  local_gateway_v4_ip  = "1.1.1.1/30"
  remote_gateway_v4_ip = "1.1.1.2/30"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `region` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specifies the region where the virtual interface is located.  
  If omitted, the provider-level region will be used. Changing this will create a new resource.

* `direct_connect_id` - (Required, String, ForceNew) Specifies the ID of the direct connection associated with the
  virtual interface.  
  Changing this will create a new resource.

* `vgw_id` - (Required, String, ForceNew) Specifies ID of the virtual gateway to which the virtual interface is
  connected.  
  Changing this will create a new resource.

* `name` - (Required, String) Specifies the name of the virtual interface.  
  The valid length is limited from `1` to `64`, only chinese and english letters, digits, hyphens (-), underscores (_)
  and dots (.) are allowed.  
  The Chinese characters must be in **UTF-8** or **Unicode** format.

* `type` - (Required, String, ForceNew) Specifies the type of the virtual interface.  
  The valid value is **private**.  
  Changing this will create a new resource.

* `route_mode` - (Required, String, ForceNew) Specifies the route mode of the virtual interface.  
  The valid values are **static** and **bgp**.  
  Changing this will create a new resource.

* `vlan` - (Required, Int, ForceNew) Specifies the VLAN for constomer side.  
  The valid value is range from `0` to `3,999`.
  Changing this will create a new resource.

* `bandwidth` - (Required, Int) Specifies the bandwidth of the virtual interface.  
  The size range depends on the direct connection.

* `remote_ep_group` - (Required, List) Specifies the CIDR list of remote subnets.  
  A CIDR that contains CIDRs of local subnet (corresponding to the parameter `local_gateway_v4_ip` or
  `local_gateway_v6_ip`) and remote subnet (corresponding to the parameter `remote_gateway_v4_ip` or
  `remote_gateway_v6_ip`) must exist in the list.

* `description` - (Optional, String) Specifies the description of the virtual interface.  
  The description contain a maximum of `128` characters and the angle brackets (< and >) are not allowed.  
  Chinese characters must be in **UTF-8** or **Unicode** format.

* `service_type` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specifies the service type of the virtual interface.  
  The valid values are **VPC**, **VGW**, **GDWW** and **LGW**. The default value is **VGW**.  
  Changing this will create a new resource.

* `local_gateway_v4_ip` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specifies the IPv4 address of the virtual interface in cloud
  side.  
  Changing this will create a new resource.

  -> Exactly one of `local_gateway_v4_ip` and `local_gateway_v6_ip` must be set.

* `remote_gateway_v4_ip` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specifies the IPv4 address of the virtual interface in client
  side.  
  Required if `local_gateway_v4_ip` is set.
  Changing this will create a new resource.

* `address_family` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specifies the service type of the virtual interface.  
  The valid values are **ipv4** and **ipv6**.  
  Changing this will create a new resource.

* `local_gateway_v6_ip` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specifies the IPv6 address of the virtual interface in cloud
  side.  
  Changing this will create a new resource.

* `remote_gateway_v6_ip` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specifies the IPv6 address of the virtual interface in client
  side.  
  Required if `local_gateway_v6_ip` is set.
  Changing this will create a new resource.

-> The CIDRs of `local_gateway_v4_ip` and `remote_gateway_v4_ip` (or `local_gateway_v6_ip` and `remote_gateway_v6_ip`)
  must be in the same subnet.

* `asn` - (Optional, Int, ForceNew) Specifies the local BGP ASN of the virtual interface.  
  The valid value is range from `1` to `4,294,967,295`, except `64,512`.
  Changing this will create a new resource.

* `bgp_md5` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specifies the (MD5) password for the local BGP.  
  Changing this will create a new resource.

* `enable_bfd` - (Optional, Bool) Specifies whether to enable the Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) function.  
  Defaults to `false`.

* `enable_nqa` - (Optional, Bool) Specifies whether to enable the Network Quality Analysis (NQA) function.  
  Defaults to `false`.

-> The values of parameter `enable_bfd` and `enable_nqa` cannot be `true` at the same time.

* `lag_id` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specifies the ID of the link aggregation group (LAG) associated with the
  virtual interface.  
  Changing this will create a new resource.

* `enterprise_project_id` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specifies the enterprise project ID to which the virtual
  interface belongs.  
  Changing this will create a new resource.

* `tags` - (Optional, Map) Specifies the key/value pairs to associate with the virtual interface.

## Attribute Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the virtual interface.

* `device_id` - The attributed device ID.

* `status` - The current status of the virtual interface.

* `created_at` - The creation time of the virtual interface.

## Import

Virtual interfaces can be imported using their `id`, e.g.

```shell
$ terraform import huaweicloud_dc_virtual_interface.test 5bb22e82-5b07-4845-bd1b-b064eca92e0a
```
