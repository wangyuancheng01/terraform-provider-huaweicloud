variable "instance_id" {}

resource "huaweicloud_dcs_hotkey_analysis" "test" {
  instance_id = var.instance_id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `region` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specifies the region in which to create the resource.
  If omitted, the provider-level region will be used. Changing this parameter will create a new resource.

The `keys` block supports:

* `name` - Indicates the name of hot key.

* `type` - Indicates the type of hot key. The value can be **string**, **list**, **set**, **zset**, **hash**.

* `shard` - Indicates the shard where the hot key is located.
  This parameter is supported only when the instance type is cluster. The format is **ip:port**.

* `db` - Indicates the database where the hot key is located.

* `size` - Indicates the size of the key value.

* `unit` - Indicates the unit of hot key. The value can be:
