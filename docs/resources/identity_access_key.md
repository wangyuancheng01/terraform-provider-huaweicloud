  name        = "user_1"
  description = "A user"
  password    = var.user_1_password
}

resource "huaweicloud_identity_access_key" "key_1" {
  user_id = huaweicloud_identity_user.user_1.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `user_id` - (Required, String, ForceNew) Specifies the ID of the user who is requesting to create an access key.
  Changing this creates a new resource.

* `description` - (Optional, String) Specifies the description of the access key.

  is *active*.

* `secret_file` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specifies the file name that can save access key and access secret key.
  Defaults to *./credentials-{{user name}}.csv*. Changing this creates a new resource.

* `pgp_key` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Either a base-64 encoded PGP public key, or a keybase username in the form
  `keybase:some_person_that_exists`. Changing this creates a new resource.

## Attribute Reference
