# huaweicloud_modelarts_notebook

Manages ModelArts notebook resource within HuaweiCloud.

## Example Usage

```hcl
variable "notebook_name" {}
variable "key_pair_name" {}
variable "ip" {}

resource "huaweicloud_modelarts_notebook" "notebook" {
  name      = var.notebook_name
  flavor_id = "modelarts.vm.cpu.2u"
  image_id  = "e1a07296-22a8-4f05-8bc8-e936c8e54090"

  allowed_access_ips = [var.ip]
  key_pair           = var.key_pair_name

  volume {
    type = "EFS"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `region` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) The region in which to create the resource. If omitted, the
  provider-level region will be used. Changing this parameter will create a new resource.

* `name` - (Required, String) Specifies the name of the notebook. The name consists of 1 to 64 characters,
 starting with a letter. Only letters, digits and underscores (_) are allowed.

* `flavor_id` - (Required, String) Specifies the flavor ID. The options are as follows:
  - **modelarts.vm.cpu.2u**: General-purpose Intel CPU specifications, suitable for data exploration and algorithm
   discovery.
  - **modelarts.vm.cpu.8u**: General computing-plus Intel CPU specifications, suitable for compute-intensive
   applications.
  - **modelarts.bm.gpu.v100NV32**: One NVIDIA V100 GPU with 32GB of memory, suitable for deep learning algorithm
   training and debugging.
  - **modelarts.bm.d910.xlarge.1**: One Ascend 910 NPU with 32GB of memory, suitable for deep learning code running
   and debugging.
  - **modelarts.bm.d910.xlarge.2**: Two Ascend 910 NPU with 32GB of memory, suitable for deep learning code running
   and debugging.
  - **modelarts.bm.d910.xlarge.8**: Eight Ascend 910 NPU with 32GB of memory, suitable for deep learning code running
   and debugging.

* `image_id` - (Required, String) Specifies the image ID of notebook.

* `volume` - (Required, List) Specifies the volume information. Structure is documented below.

* `description` - (Optional, String) Specifies the description of notebook. It contains a maximum of 512 characters and
 cannot contain special characters `&<>"'/`.

* `key_pair` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specifies the key pair name for remote SSH access.
 Changing this parameter will create a new resource.

* `allowed_access_ips` - (Optional, List) Specifies public IP addresses that are allowed for remote SSH access.
 If the parameter is not specified, all IP addresses will be allowed for remote SSH access.

* `pool_id` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specifies the ID of Dedicated resource pool which the notebook used.
 Changing this parameter will create a new resource.

* `workspace_id` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specifies the workspace ID which the notebook belongs to.
 The default value is `0`. Changing this parameter will create a new resource.

The `volume` block supports:

* `type` - (Required, String, ForceNew) Specifies the volume type. The options are as follows:
  - *EFS*: use Scalable File Service, default 50GB is **free**.
  - *EVS*: use Elastic Volume Service, default size is 5 GB.
  
 Changing this parameter will create a new resource.

* `size` - (Optional, Int) Specifies the volume size. Its value range is from 5 GB to 4096 GB.

* `ownership` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specifies the volume ownership. The options are as follows:
  - *MANAGED*: shared storage disk of the ModelArts service.
  - *DEDICATED*: dedicated storage disk, only supported when the category is `EFS`.

 Changing this parameter will create a new resource.

* `uri` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specifies the uri of dedicated storage disk, which is mandatory when the `type`
 is `EFS` and the `ownership` is `DEDICATED`. Example: `192.168.0.1:/user-9sfdsdgdfgh5ea4d56871e75d6966aa274/mount/`.
 Changing this parameter will create a new resource.
