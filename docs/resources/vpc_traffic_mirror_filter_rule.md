  direction                = "ingress"
  protocol                 = "tcp"
  ethertype                = "IPv4"
  action                   = "accept"
  priority                 = 1
  source_cidr_block        = "10.0.0.0/8"
  source_port_range        = "80-90"
  destination_cidr_block   = "192.168.1.0/24"
  destination_port_range   = "10-65535"
}

  The smaller the priority number, the higher the priority.

* `source_cidr_block` - (Optional, String) Specifies the source IP address of the traffic traffic mirror filter rule.

* `source_port_range` - (Optional, String) Specifies the source port number range of the traffic mirror filter rule.
