# cce-with-kubernetes

In this example, we will create a CCE cluster with EIP,
then we will use the Kubernetes provider to connect and manage the cluster.
We authenticate to the cluster with certificate.
And we will manage the storage of the cluster with Kubernetes provider.

For more information about the storage,
[please see document](https://support.huaweicloud.com/intl/en-us/usermanual-cce/cce_10_0307.html).
